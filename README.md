# Identity-Preserved Speech Translation: Literature Review

This repository contains a SurVis visualization for my MSc Computer Science literature review on Identity-Preserved Speech Translation techniques.

## Literature Review Focus

This literature review examines research addressing the challenge of preserving voice characteristics and emotional congruence in speech translation systems, organized into four main categories:

1. **Survey of Emotional Prosody** - Comprehensive review of emotional prosody research
2. **End-to-End Speech Translation Systems** - Direct speech-to-speech translation models
3. **Visual Embodiment in Speech Translation** - Methods for preserving visual expressiveness
4. **Evaluation and Quality Assessment** - Metrics and methodologies for quality evaluation
